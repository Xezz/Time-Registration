This is a NON-WORKING application
I intend to create an application for a friend to get some experience in deploying spring apps.
At the same time I learn the basics of spring myself, so it's a win-win situation.

The purpose of this application is to track the time one used on a specific project. Since there is usually more than a single person working on said project, it is going to split between:
    - Company
    - Project
    - Coworker
    - Timeframe

As im still experimenting with different technologies and learning how to develop a decent RESTful service this won't be useful right now.

Currently leaking Memory due to HSQLDB reference.
